# 3. Non-Functional Requirements

## 3.1 Overview

Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the BidSense platform. These requirements ensure that the application is secure, scalable, maintainable, performant, and production-ready.

Unlike functional requirements, these requirements describe **how** the system should operate rather than **what** it should do.

---

# 3.2 Performance

## Objectives

The platform must provide a fast and responsive user experience under normal operating conditions.

### Requirements

* Average API response time should be less than **300 ms** for standard CRUD operations.
* AI requests should return an initial response within **5–15 seconds**, depending on model latency.
* Dashboard data should load in less than **2 seconds**.
* File uploads should support documents up to **100 MB**.
* Pagination should be applied to all large datasets.
* Database queries should use indexes where appropriate.
* Expensive queries should be optimized and cached.

---

# 3.3 Scalability

The system must scale horizontally as the number of users and organizations grows.

### Requirements

* Stateless backend services.
* Independent API instances.
* Horizontal scaling using Docker containers.
* Database connection pooling.
* Redis for caching and session storage.
* Vector database for semantic search.
* Support thousands of concurrent users.

---

# 3.4 Availability

The platform should remain available even during maintenance or component failures.

### Target

* 99.9% uptime

### Requirements

* Health check endpoints.
* Graceful shutdown.
* Automatic service restart.

* Retry mechanisms for external APIs.

---

# 3.5 Reliability

The platform should operate consistently without data corruption.

### Requirements

* Database transactions for critical operations.
* Idempotent payment webhooks.
* Retry failed background jobs.
* Prevent duplicate submissions.
* Validate all incoming data.

---

# 3.6 Security

Security is a primary architectural concern.

### Authentication

* JWT Access Tokens
* Refresh Tokens

---

# 3.10 Error Handling

The application should provide consistent and meaningful error responses.

### Requirements

* Standard API response format
* Global error handler
* Validation errors
* Business errors
* Database errors

* AI provider errors

Sensitive implementation details must never be exposed to clients.

---

# 3.11 Data Integrity

The system must preserve data consistency.

### Requirements

* Foreign key relationships
* Database constraints
* Unique indexes
* Transactions
* Soft deletes where appropriate
* Optimistic updates when required

---

# 3.12 Backup & Recovery

### Requirements
