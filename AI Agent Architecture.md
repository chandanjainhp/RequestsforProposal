# 16. AI Agent Architecture

## 16.1 Overview

BidSense adopts a multi-agent AI architecture rather than relying on a single general-purpose assistant.

Each AI agent specializes in a specific procurement domain while sharing common infrastructure such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt management, memory, and AI providers.

This architecture improves:

* Accuracy
* Maintainability
* Explainability
* Scalability
* Reusability

---

# 16.2 Objectives

The AI Agent System is designed to:

* Specialize AI tasks.
* Reduce prompt complexity.
* Improve response quality.
* Reuse AI components.
* Support future AI agents.
* Enable intelligent procurement workflows.
* Provide explainable AI recommendations.

├── Prompt Builder
├── Memory Manager
├── Embedding Service
├── Provider Factory
├── Citation Builder
├── Response Parser
└── Audit Logger
```

# 16.19 Confidence Scoring

Every agent returns confidence metrics.

Example

```json
{
  "agent": "Proposal Reviewer",
  "confidence": 0.94,
