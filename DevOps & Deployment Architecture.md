# 24. DevOps & Deployment Architecture

## 24.1 Overview

The DevOps architecture defines how BidSense is built, tested, deployed, monitored, and maintained across development, staging, and production environments.

The primary objectives are:

* Reliable deployments
* High availability
* Automated CI/CD
* Easy scalability
* Infrastructure consistency
* Secure deployments
* Observability
* Disaster recovery

The platform is containerized using Docker and designed to support future Kubernetes deployment.

---

# 24.2 DevOps Goals

The deployment platform is designed to provide:

* Zero-downtime deployments
* Automated testing
* Infrastructure as Code
* Environment isolation
* Fast rollback
* Horizontal scalability
* Continuous monitoring
* Automated backups
