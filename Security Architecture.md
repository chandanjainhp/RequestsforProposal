# 23. Security Architecture

## 23.1 Overview

Security is a foundational principle of the BidSense platform. Every layer of the application—from the frontend to AI processing, databases, infrastructure, and third-party integrations—is designed with security controls that protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The security architecture follows a **Defense-in-Depth** strategy, where multiple independent layers work together to reduce the impact of vulnerabilities and attacks.

The architecture is aligned with:

* OWASP Top 10
* OWASP API Security Top 10
* Security by Design
* Least Privilege Principle
* Zero Trust Principles
* Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)

---

# 23.2 Security Objectives

The security architecture aims to:

* Protect organization data.
* Prevent unauthorized access.
* Secure AI interactions.
* Protect uploaded documents.
* Secure payment processing.
* Ensure auditability.
* Detect suspicious activities.
* Support future compliance requirements.

# 23.4 Authentication Security

Authentication is implemented using

* JWT Access Tokens
* Refresh Tokens
* bcrypt Password Hashing
* OTP Verification
* Email Verification

Access Token

* Short lifetime
* Stored in memory
* Sent using Authorization header

Refresh Token

* Long lifetime
* HttpOnly Cookie
* Secure Cookie
* SameSite Protection

---

# 23.5 Authorization

Authorization uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Supported Roles

* Super Admin
* Organization Admin
* Procurement Manager
* Procurement Officer
* Vendor
* Viewer

Every protected endpoint validates

* Authentication
* Organization ownership
* Required permissions
* Resource ownership

---

# 23.6 Multi-Tenant Isolation

Every business record belongs to an organization.

Example

```text
organization_id
```

Every repository query automatically filters by

```sql
organization_id = currentOrganization
```

This prevents cross-organization data access.

---

# 23.7 Password Security

Passwords are

* Never stored in plaintext
* Hashed using bcrypt
* Salted automatically

Password policy

* Minimum 8 characters
* Uppercase letter
* Lowercase letter
* Number
* Special character

Future enhancements

* Password history
* Password expiration
* Breached password detection

---

Headers include

* X-Frame-Options

* Content-Security-Policy
* Referrer-Policy

---

# 23.9 Input Validation

Every request is validated.

Validation covers

* Body
* Query
* Parameters
* Headers
* Uploaded files

Validation uses

* Zod
* Custom validators

Invalid requests never reach business logic.

---

# 23.10 SQL Injection Protection

Database access is performed exclusively through Drizzle ORM.

Protection includes

* Parameterized queries
* Prepared statements
* No raw SQL from user input
* Input validation
* Repository pattern

Unsafe query construction is prohibited.

---

# 23.11 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Protection includes

* Input sanitization
* Output encoding
* Content Security Policy
* HTML sanitization
* Safe Markdown rendering

User-generated HTML is never rendered directly.

---

# 23.12 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Protection includes

* HttpOnly Cookies
* SameSite Cookies
* CSRF Tokens (when cookie-based state-changing endpoints require them)
* Origin validation

---

# 23.13 Rate Limiting

Redis-backed rate limiting protects public endpoints.

Examples

| Endpoint | Limit           |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Login    | 5/minute/IP     |
| Register | 5/minute/IP     |
| OTP      | 3/minute        |
| AI Chat  | Plan-based      |
| Upload   | Plan-based      |
| API      | 100/minute/User |

Repeated abuse may result in temporary blocking.

---

# 23.14 File Upload Security

Every uploaded file is checked.

Validation includes

* MIME Type
* File Extension
* Maximum Size
* Malware Scan
* Duplicate Detection

Executable files are rejected.

Supported files

* PDF
* DOCX
* XLSX
* CSV
* Images

---

# 23.15 Document Security

Documents are protected using

* Organization isolation
* Permission validation
* Secure storage
* Signed URLs (future)
* Audit logging

Only authorized users can access documents.

---

# 23.16 AI Security

AI introduces unique security risks.

Protection includes

* Prompt sanitization
* Prompt injection detection
* Context isolation
* Organization filtering
* Output validation
* Token limits
* Citation validation

AI must never expose another organization's documents.

---

# 23.17 RAG Security

Retrieval security includes

* Organization filtering
* Metadata filtering
* Permission filtering
* Vector access validation

Every vector search is scoped to the authenticated organization.

---

# 23.18 Secret Management

Secrets are never stored in source code.

Examples

* JWT Secret
* Database Password
* Redis Password
* Gemini API Key
* Sarvam API Key
* Razorpay Secret
* SMTP Credentials

Development

```text
.env
```

# 23.29 Summary

The BidSense Security Architecture provides layered protection across authentication, authorization, APIs, AI, document processing, payments, and infrastructure. By combining RBAC, multi-tenant isolation, secure token management, input validation, encrypted communication, audit logging, and AI-specific safeguards, the platform minimizes security risks while supporting enterprise-grade procurement workflows. The modular design also allows future adoption of advanced security features such as MFA, SSO, and automated threat detection without significant architectural changes.
