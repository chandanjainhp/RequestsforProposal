# 25. Testing Architecture

## 25.1 Overview

Testing is a critical component of the BidSense platform. Every layer of the application—from the frontend to the backend, AI services, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), databases, and integrations—is verified through automated and manual testing.

The testing strategy follows the **Test Pyramid**, emphasizing a larger number of fast unit tests, fewer integration tests, and a smaller number of end-to-end tests.

The objectives are:

* Ensure correctness
* Prevent regressions
* Improve maintainability
* Validate AI responses
* Verify security controls
* Support continuous delivery

---

# 25.2 Testing Objectives

The testing architecture aims to:

* Validate business logic.
* Detect regressions early.
* Verify API behavior.
* Test AI features.
* Validate RAG retrieval.
* Ensure payment correctness.
* Improve deployment confidence.
* Support CI/CD automation.

---

# 25.12 Prompt Testing

Each prompt template is tested.

Validation includes

* Variables substituted correctly
* Context formatting
* Token limits
* Instruction completeness
* Provider compatibility

Prompt versioning enables regression testing.

---

# 25.13 Database Testing

Database tests verify

* CRUD Operations
* Relationships
* Transactions
* Foreign Keys
