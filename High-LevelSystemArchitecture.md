# 4. High-Level System Architecture

## 4.1 Overview

BidSense is designed as a modular, AI-first, cloud-ready Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform. The architecture follows a layered approach with clearly separated responsibilities to ensure maintainability, scalability, security, and future extensibility.

The platform integrates traditional procurement workflows with Artificial Intelligence, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), document processing, and subscription management.

The architecture is designed around the following principles:

* Clean Architecture
* Separation of Concerns
* Modular Services
* Provider Pattern
* Repository Pattern
* API-First Design
* AI-Ready Infrastructure
* Multi-Tenant Support
* Horizontal Scalability

---

# 4.4 Request Lifecycle

A standard API request follows the path below.

# 4.8 Security Flow

Every protected request follows this sequence:

1. Client sends JWT Access Token.
2. Authentication middleware validates the token.
3. User information is attached to the request.
4. Permission middleware checks required permissions.
5. Request validation executes.
6. Controller processes the request.
7. Response is returned.

Unauthorized requests terminate immediately with an appropriate HTTP status code.

# 4.9 External Services

BidSense integrates with the following external systems:

| Service               | Purpose                             |

# 4.11 Summary

This architecture separates concerns into dedicated layers while maintaining clear communication paths between components. The modular design allows independent evolution of AI providers, payment gateways, storage solutions, and external integrations without affecting core business logic.

The result is a scalable, maintainable, and production-ready foundation suitable for enterprise procurement workflows and future platform growth.
