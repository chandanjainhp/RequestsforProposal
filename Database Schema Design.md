# 8. Database Schema Design

## 8.1 Overview

This chapter defines the complete database schema for BidSense.

The database is implemented using **PostgreSQL** with **Drizzle ORM**.

Every schema is designed using:

* UUID Primary Keys
* Foreign Key Constraints
* Soft Deletes
* Automatic Timestamps
* Optimized Indexes
* Organization Isolation
* ACID Transactions

# 8.33 Summary

The BidSense database schema is designed for scalability, maintainability, and enterprise procurement workflows. PostgreSQL stores transactional business data, Drizzle ORM provides type-safe schema management and queries, Redis handles temporary and cached data, and Qdrant stores vector embeddings for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The schema supports multi-tenancy, secure authentication, AI-powered document analysis, subscription billing, and future platform expansion without major structural changes.
